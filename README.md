# Duckilous' Hitman Mods

**This is a collection of mods that I've made for HITMAN (3): World of Assassination.**  
Place them in the "Mods" folder of [Simple Mod Framework](https://github.com/atampy25/simple-mod-framework) to use them.

## Numbered Barcode

Updates 47's barcode and adds the numbers "640509-040147" below it. 

If there's other mods installed that edits 47's face texture (00D247582859CA87.TEXT + 007B3B5C90C8B81F.TEXD) such as Classic Face Texture, this mod will not be compatible with it as either mod overrides the other. Currently doesn't affect 47's makeup texture as Helmut Kruger.

## Unlimited Saves for Master Difficulty

Have you ever wanted to play the game in Master difficulty because you like the challenge of extra enforcers, cameras and such, but you think being able to save once is too much because you value saving your time or you like to experiment in this mode? No worries, this is the mod for you.

It does exactly what it says: allows you to save the game in Master difficulty as many times as you like. Only works in offline however.

___

## 2 Breaching Charges

Gives 47 an additional Remote Breaching Charge just like in HITMAN 2016. That's literally it. Only works in offline mode.

___

## Map Enhancements from Benchmark

This mod brings over the map enhancements from the benchmark over to the game.
And I mean exactly from the benchmark so only Dubai and Dartmoor. Make sure you have Simulation Quality set to "Best"!
Now works online! Special thanks to Kevin Rudd and invalid for helping me out.

I honestly have no idea what kind of enhancements there are for Dubai but I definitely know for sure that Dartmoor has destructible physics!
In one room only lmao. So yeah, I told you, this mod isn't actually significant and I put most of my effort into making a dumb thumbnail. Goodbye.

## Ambrose Island Storyline Placement

This is just a very trivial mod that adds Ambrose Island's "Shadows in the Water" story mission to HITMAN 2's storyline in the campaign menu and not much else. Not only do some might think this is unnecessary, it's also almost useless as it only works offline lmao.

This mod also allows the player to seamlessly play "Shadows in the Water" next instead of "The Ark Society" after the completion of
"Another Life". Finishing "Shadows in the Water" will also display "The Ark Society" next.
Special thanks to Kevin Rudd for helping me out with this feature.

"Shadows in the Water" is said to take place in HITMAN 2's storyline after the events of "Another Life" where the Isle of Sg√†il was discovered in the "Gifts and Curses" cinematic but 47 didn't infiltrate until a couple months later. It's safe to assume that the mission at Ambrose Island happened prior to that time.

I made this mod just to practise how SMF works in patching JSON files and I figure why not share it here.
Surely there's at least somebody here who would appreciate it.
